# Match between system and the real world

The system should speak the usersâ€™ language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

## Examples

### Helena
At first glance, the light switch seems to "speak the user's language". Most people would probably know the words "Ydre" (i.e., outer), "Indre" (i.e., inner), and "Tavle" (i.e., blackboard). In this specific case, I have no idea what "Ydre" and "Indre" corresponds to. "Tavle" is more obvious as I expect it to turn on the light at the physical board in the room.
