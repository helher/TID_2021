# Consistency and standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

## Examples

### Helena
As evinent on the image, we can see two light bulb icons, as well as a odd-looking icon (not really sure what it is - guess it represents the blackboard). It is difficult to tell the difference between the two light bulb icons (why should we have two identical icons?). Also, it is difficult to tell whether the icon-side or text-side enables the light function.
